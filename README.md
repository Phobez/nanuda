## About This Project
Users create a ”group” composed of either one
person (themselves) or several people. Users then invite these
people to the group. Users add expenses and split the costs with
either all, some, or no members of the group. Users can add
descriptions for each expense. Users can also customise how the
costs are split. Users can see a summary of how much they owe
to others and how much others owe to others. The summary of
how much users owe changes as users spend and pay.
